Imperative vs Declarativelike

Declarative -> ex. what house looks like (OOP)
Imperative -> ex. how to build the house (functional)

Concept of functional programming:
1. immutability - all data is immutable - ex. x=3 so You need to treat as x is 3 (all data are immutable) 
2. functional purity - none of our functions should refer to any kind of state, they should all be pure - it means, you
should design your objects whit no option to change state of it
3. first-class functions





Partial application - dividing application on small parts?
