Imperative vs Declarativelike

Declarative -> ex. what house looks like (OOP)
Imperative -> ex. how to build the house (functional)

Concept of functional programming:
1. immutability - all data is immutable - ex. x=3 so You need to treat as x is 3 (all data are immutable) 
2. functional purity
3. first-class functions
