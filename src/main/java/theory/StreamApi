Reduce concept:
Identity â€“ an element that is the initial value of the reduction operation and the default result if the stream is empty
Accumulator â€“ a function that takes two parameters: a partial result of the reduction operation and the next element of the stream
Combiner â€“ a function used to combine the partial result of the reduction operation when the reduction is parallelized or when there's a mismatch between the types of the accumulator arguments and the types of the accumulator implementation


stream.reduce([identity] 0, ([acumulator with two parameters] k,v ) -> [combiner] k+v);
